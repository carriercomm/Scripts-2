Python Implementation of Global Load Balancer using Geo IP Locating database. 
It features HTTP and TCP health checks and two routing algorithms - Geo IP Country and Random.

The config file is /etc/geolb.conf

The program is daemonized and can be started/stopped/restarted by running:

$ python geo_lb.py start

The main program pre-forks 10 (configurable) child work processes that will do the CPU bound packet inspection and manipulation.

A separate dedicated child process is forked and allocated to the health monitor.
The health monitor process starts 5 (configurable) threads to do the IO bound MySql operations.

The Geo IP database is a free version from MaxMind, with about 98% accuracy.
